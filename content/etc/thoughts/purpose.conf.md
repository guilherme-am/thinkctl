## Why This Exists

I've been thinking a lot about systems — not just the technical kind, but the human ones too. How we build things
together, how we share what we learn, how we make technology more sustainable and
collaborative.

**thinkctl.dev** is my space to think out loud about that.

It's not a portfolio. It's not a tutorial site. It's not me trying to prove I know things.

It's just... thinking in motion. Documenting what I'm learning, what I'm curious about, and what I'm still figuring out.

## What I Care About

I love **open source**. Not just the code, but the spirit of it — people building things together, sharing knowledge,
helping each other get better.

I care about **sustainability**. Not just environmental (though that matters), but building systems that don't burn
people out, that use resources wisely, that can be maintained long-term.

I'm fascinated by **infrastructure** — the systems that help other systems work. Platform engineering, observability,
reliability. The stuff that makes collaboration possible at scale.

And lately, I've been exploring **AI and agents** — not as replacements for humans, but as tools that can help us build
better things together, if we're thoughtful about it.

## What This Blog Is

This is a place for:

- Reflecting on systems that worked (and why)
- Documenting things that failed (and what I learned)
- Exploring trade-offs between theory and reality
- Thinking about how technology shapes collaboration
- Sharing what I'm learning, even when I'm not sure yet

I write about things I'm genuinely curious about. Sometimes that's Kubernetes, sometimes it's MLOps,
sometimes it's just "why does this system exist?"

## What This Blog Isn't

This isn't:

- A place to show off
- A collection of "best practices" without context
- A tutorial dump
- Me pretending I have all the answers

I'm still learning. I make mistakes. I change my mind. That's okay.

## Who This Is For

If you've ever:

- Debugged something at 3am and wondered "why is this so complicated?"
- Cared about making systems more sustainable
- Wanted to understand trade-offs, not just solutions
- Believed that collaboration makes everything better
- Loved open source and the people behind it

...then maybe this blog is for you.

Or maybe you just stumbled here and you're curious. That's cool too.

## How I Write

I try to write **with** you, not **at** you.

I use "we" a lot because I believe we're all learning together.
I ask questions because I'm genuinely curious what you think.
I stay humble because I know I don't have all the answers.

If something I write helps you, that's amazing. If you have a better idea, I'd love to hear it.

## Summary

**thinkctl.dev** is where I document how systems work, fail, and improve — and how we can build them better together.

It's maintained by someone who loves open source, cares about sustainability, and is always learning.

Thanks for being here.
