Hi! I'm Guilherme.

I build systems that help people work together — the infrastructure kind, mostly. Platform engineering, reliability,
observability. The stuff that makes other things possible.

## What I Do

I've worked across different domains:

- **Telecom** — 5G/6G networks, edge computing, distributed systems
- **Automotive R&D** — Real-time infrastructure for autonomous systems
- **SaaS Platforms** — Cloud-native apps, DevOps, SRE practices
- **MLOps** — ML infrastructure, agent orchestration, making AI systems observable

Right now, I'm exploring how AI agents can help us build better systems — not replace us, but work alongside us.

## What I Believe

I think **systems exist to connect people**, not just machines.

Reliability isn't just about uptime — it's about trust, predictability, and keeping promises to the people who depend
on your systems.

Automation should reduce toil, but it shouldn't hide complexity. We need to understand what we're building.

And sustainability matters. Not just environmental (though that's important), but building systems that don't burn
people out, that use resources wisely, that can be maintained long-term.

## What I Love

I love **open source**. The community, the collaboration, the spirit of building things together and sharing what we learn.

I love **Linux and systems**. There's something beautiful about understanding how things work at a fundamental level.

I love **learning from others**. Every conversation, every code review, every incident postmortem teaches me something new.

## What I'm Learning

I'm always learning. Right now:

- How to make AI systems more reliable and observable
- Better ways to build platform infrastructure
- How to write about technical things in a way that's actually helpful
- How to balance sustainability with performance

I don't have all the answers. I'm figuring it out as I go, just like everyone else.

Thanks for stopping by. Let's build something good together.
