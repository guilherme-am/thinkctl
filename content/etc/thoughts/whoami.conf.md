## Background

I build and operate systems that connect people, machines, and data at scale.

My work spans:

- **Telecom**: 5G/6G, edge computing, distributed cloud
- **Automotive R&D**: Autonomous systems, real-time infrastructure
- **SaaS Platforms**: Cloud-native applications, DevOps, SRE
- **MLOps**: ML infrastructure, agent orchestration, observability

## Current Focus

- Platform engineering for AI systems
- Agent-based architectures
- Reliability at scale
- Infrastructure as enabler, not blocker

## Philosophy

Systems exist to **connect people**, not just machines.

Reliability is a human concern, not only a technical one.

Automation should reduce toil, not hide complexity.

This system is maintained by someone who believes infrastructure shapes the world,
and that improving these systems makes technology more inclusive, sustainable, and resilient.
