## Why this exists under `agents/`

This topic shows up in two places:

- `platform/docs.d/` as part of the “documentation as engineering” series
- `agents/` because it’s also about building human+agent workflows

Rather than maintain two divergent copies, the **canonical unit** lives here:

- `/etc/thoughts/platform/docs/050-documenting-for-ai-agents`

If you arrived here first, start with the canonical unit above.
