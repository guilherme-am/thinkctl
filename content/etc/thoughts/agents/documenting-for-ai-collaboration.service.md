## Why this lives in two places

I wrote about documenting for AI agents as part of my "documentation as engineering" series in the platform section. But it also fits here under `agents/` because it's fundamentally about human+AI collaboration.

Rather than duplicate the content (and then have two versions drift apart), here's where to find the full post:

**[Documenting for AI collaboration](/etc/thoughts/platform/docs/050-documenting-for-ai-agents)**

The short version: good documentation helps both humans and AI agents work together more effectively. Clear structure, explicit commands, and decision records make collaboration smoother for everyone.

If you're interested in how AI agents can help with platform work, or how to write documentation that works for both humans and machines, check out the full post above.
